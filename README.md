## Inspiration
Just in the US, it is estimated that about 20% of the population suffers from an invisible disease. These people avoid asking for accommodations in fear of backlash from the rest of society.

## Solution
We decided to build a web application where people with invisible disabilities can order government-approved badges. They can first find the badge of their choice from the 'Your Order' page. They can then fill in the necessary shipment details and additional documents for verification. After submitting the form, the documents are reviewed and the shipment is sent out. The badge will signal to the rest of society that the badge holder's disease is legitimate and he/she shouldn't receive the scorn of others when they use services for the disabled. This is a campaign we would want the government to implement so the badges are considered legitimate.
